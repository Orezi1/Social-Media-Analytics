# Social Media Posts Analytics â€“ End-to-End Excel Project  

## Project Overview  
This project demonstrates how raw social media performance data can be transformed into **actionable business insights** using Excel.  
The workflow includes **data cleaning, analysis with Pivot Tables, and an interactive dashboard** for decision-making.  

The dataset simulates a companyâ€™s social media posts across different platforms.  
The goal is to identify the types of content that drive the most **engagement and reach**, and to present findings in a professional, dynamic dashboard.  


## ðŸ”¹ Objectives  
- Clean and prepare raw data for analysis  
- Identify patterns in post performance (engagement, reach, impressions)  
- Highlight top-performing posts and underperforming ones  
- Create an **automated dashboard** for stakeholders to explore insights interactively  


## ðŸ”¹ Workflow  

### **1. Data Cleaning (Sheet: WORKING DATA)**  
- Removed duplicate entries to ensure accuracy  
- Standardized **date formats** for consistency in time-based analysis  
- Normalized post type and platform names (text cleaning)  
- Filled or handled missing values in key metrics (e.g., Reach, Engagement, Impressions)  
- Created calculated columns (Engagement Rate, CTR where relevant)  

âœ… **Outcome:** A clean dataset ready for reliable analysis  


### **2. Data Analysis (Sheet: PIVOT TABLES)**  
- Built pivot tables to summarize:  
  - Engagement by platform  
  - Post reach by content type  
  - Daily/Monthly posting trends  
- Compared performance across different content formats (video, images, text)  
- Segmented top 10 posts by engagement  

**Outcome:** Discovered which content formats and platforms delivered the highest ROI  


### **3. Visualization & Dashboard (Sheet: DASHBOARD)**  
- Developed an **interactive Excel dashboard** with:  
  - Slicers for filtering by platform, content type, and time range  
  - KPIs: Total Reach, Average Engagement Rate, Top 5 Posts  
  - Trendline charts to visualize growth over time  
  - Comparative charts (platform vs. engagement)  


## ðŸ”¹ Key Insights  
Video content generated the **highest engagement rates**, more than double that of image posts  
Instagram posts consistently drove the **largest share of engagement**, while LinkedIn posts delivered stronger reach per post  
Weekday posts tended to perform better in impressions compared to weekends
